# Repair-Buddy

I currently work in a repair shop. 
I wanted to make repair easier to track. This app is for the everyday DIY mechanic to the professional mechanic.
 After logging with my test account you will have a list of "jobs" you are working on. 
If you go into the job you will see the images of the teardown. 
You will be able to add tags to the image. I
E "4 10mm bolts" "door removal" This can help keep track of your repairs. 

It's a better way to keep track of the repairs rather just keeping the photos on your phone.
